# Starkey
A data-science programming langauge made to make the manipulation and handling of data precise, deliberate, and free of error.

## An explanation
> This repository was original going to be used for `Lamuta` which was an educational programming language designed to make low-level concept easier to understand.
> I decided to put that idea on hold and refocus my efforts on Starkey. That said, the code for this was way better than Starkey, so I'm just going to transfer the repository over to here.
> For a more detailed history, see the `Starkey-legacy` repository activity
> This project has previous version in private repos dating back to March of 2024, which is public: `https://github.com/alarie-c/darcylang`
